🎒 Work:
I mostly use Linux as a operating system for most IT developments, and Visual Code as IDE. I mostly use GNU GCC as a compiler, CMake as a compilation setup, Linux Bash Scripts for many tasks, and in C++ I also supplement myself with C++ STL and some C++ Libraries.  

*In the past I used to code in Netbeans and Vim*
