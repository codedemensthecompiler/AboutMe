# About Me

Personal & IT brief. Skills, Experience, Reference.

👦🏻 My name is Dawid Jakubowski, 25 year old, also known as *Codedemens The Compiler*, I specialize in C++ and software engineering. I've started self-taughting myself over 12 years ago programming in ActionScript 3, software engineering basics, and C#. My experience I've gained through coding my own software pieces & projects.

🎓 Most of my skills:
 - C++ (Experienced)
 - Software Engineering (Quite Experienced)
 - C++ STL (Quite Experienced)
 - Lua (Intermediate)
 - CMake (Intermediate)
 - Linux (Intermediate)
 - Linux Bash (Intermediate)

🎒 Work:
I mostly use Linux as a operating system for most IT developments, and Visual Code as IDE. I mostly use GNU GCC as a compiler, CMake as a compilation setup, Linux Bash Scripts for many tasks, and in C++ I also supplement myself with C++ STL and some C++ Libraries.  

*In the past I used to code in Netbeans and Vim*
